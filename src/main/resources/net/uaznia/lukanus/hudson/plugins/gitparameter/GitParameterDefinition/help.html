<div>
  <p>When used, this parameter will present a build-time choice to select a Git tag (or revision number) which sets a parameter for the parametrized build.</p>
  <p>Be aware that git does not allow us to get additional information (like author/commmit date) from a remote URL. This plugin will silently clone the project when your workspace is empty. This may take a long time with a slow connection and/or the checkout is big.</p>
  <p>Your workspace is empty when you start the first build or when you have explicitely deleted the workspace.</p>
  <p>Often the parameter defined in the "Name" field is used to specify the branch of the git checkout.</p>
